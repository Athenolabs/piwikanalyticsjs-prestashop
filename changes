Version: 0.8.3
    * Seriously improve the world crappiest configuration wizard, :)
    - it has been completely redesigned with usability in mind
    
    * Use PS core function Validate::isUrl instead of useless php filter_var

    * add initial setup for update check, not implemented yet but the basics have been set
    - only for Prestashop 1.6.0.4 and up.

    * fixed var $this->_errors, must be an array

    * use comma instead of ' ' in set Domains so we can take advantages of jQuery.tags
    - also makes it more readable
