In this folder you find modified files from the default theme in PrestaShop.

the files are modified to illustrate how you can integrate more Piwik functionality into your shop.

all files placed here are tested unless stated otherwise within that file.

the files are are NOT INSTALLED into your shop or theme that you will have to ask your web-developer to do for you

*I do not provide ANY support on these files, they are purely for show*, while they work in my development environment there is the possibility that they will not work for you,
however the files provide a show and tell of how you may use the Piwik tracker within your shop's theme.
